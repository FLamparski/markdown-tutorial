### Hello, Markdown

Markdown is expressed using plain text, which makes it extremely portable and
lightweight (even more so than HTML). In fact, some find it easy to read even
in its source form.

Below is an editor and a preview pane side by side: this will allow you to see
what you're doing instantly. The editor will highlight certain features of the
syntax for you -- which is a handy preview on its own.

```
The basic Markdown document is any string of unicode characters, which means
that the English "Hello", the Polish "Cześć", and the Emoji "👋" are all valid.

Paragraphs in Markdown are separated by at least one line of whitespace. This
means that if you are typing, you can press "Enter" twice to make a new
paragraph. You can try it yourself! Move the second sentence below to its own
paragraph.

This is a paragraph. This should be another paragraph.
```

_(Once completed: Show toast)_ **Great!** Paragraphs are the main building blocks
of Markdown documents.
<span style="float: right">[Next Exercise] _or press Ctrl-Enter_</span>

```
Paragraphs can be written as long lines like in a word processor, or with single
line breaks to make the source text fit your editor better. If you choose to
break your lines, Markdown will automatically insert spaces between words for
you. In most cases, the formatting of the source text doesn't matter at all!

But what if you need to make a line break in the midst of a paragraph? You can
leave two spaces after a line, or a single backslash (\):

This is a rubbish poem  
but has to be formatted  
this certain way.

Another rubbish poem\
that shows you Markdown's\
backslash line breaks.

This poem is for you
to format like it should
appear on the screen.

The last one is for you to add line breaks to! _Please note that not all
versions of Markdown support backslash line breaks, but the double spaces will
work everywhere._
